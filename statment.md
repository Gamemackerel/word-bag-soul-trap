Neutron stars are the densest objects in the universe that don't collapse into themselves to become a black hole. Inside, matter is compressed beyond comprehension, creating "strange matter", which lacks our familiar particles such as photons. It is a soup of deconfined quarks, acting in perverse ways.

Inside of datacenters run by corporations with valuations of trillions of dollars, language is compressed and perverted. What is produced is strange and unnatural. It occasionally resembles words and language, but it is also not language. It says things without meaning, and means without saying. Without understanding these systems, we use them more and more everyday, often through chat-style interfaces that we have come to trust.

Word bag, using a low power usage free open source language model set to generate infinitely with no instruction, serves as a example and illustration for the absurdity of language being produced in a vacuum, without anything physically underpinning it. The barren language personalities that offer therapy, addict your child with a fascimile of romance or friendship: they are simply and strangely a bag of stolen words.
