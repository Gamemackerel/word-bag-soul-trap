Neutron stars are the densest objects in the universe that don't collapse into themselves to become a black hole. Inside, matter is compressed beyond comprehension, creating "strange matter", which lacks our familiar particles such as photons. It is a soup of deconfined quarks, acting in perverse ways.

Inside of datacenters run by corporations with valuations of trillions of dollars, language is compressed and perverted. What is produced by condensing all of written human language and thought into a process on a single computer is strange and unnatural. It occasionally resembles words and language, but it is strange language. It says things without meaning, and means things without saying them. Without understanding, we use it more and more everyday, often through chat-style interfaces that we have come to trust as the medium other humans interact with us through.

Wordocean, using a low power usage free open source language model set to generate infinitely with no instruction, serves as a example and illustration for the absurdity of language being produced in a vacuum, without anything physically underpinning it. The barren language personalities that offer therapy, addict your child with a fascimile of romance or friendship: they are fundementally a bag of strange and stolen words.
